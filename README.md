# DTSC 580: Data Manipulation

## Assignment: Halloween Candy

### Name: Kurtis Crowe

## Overview

The Halloween Candy assignment tasks students with cleaning and wrangling data from a survey of Halloween candy to prepare it for a machine learning project. Upon completing the tasks outlined in the notebook, students are required to save the notebook as `halloween_candy` and ensure that all tests pass in CodeGrade. For those proficient in Pandas, additional optional data analysis questions are provided at the end of the assignment for extra practice.

## Data Set

The dataset used in this assignment is the 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy dataset, discussed in this [boingboing](https://boingboing.net/2017/10/30/the-2017-halloween-candy-hiera.html) article. Further details about the data can be found in the [Science Creative Quarterly](https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/).

The survey included rating instructions:
> Basically, consider that feeling you get when you receive this item in your Halloween haul. Does it make you really happy (JOY)? Or is it something that you automatically place in the junk pile (DESPAIR)? MEH for indifference, and you can leave blank if you have no idea what the item is.

Note that the original dataset has been slightly altered for this assignment. For future analysis, one would need to download the data directly from the provided links.

This dataset exemplifies a messy dataset, especially due to respondents being allowed to enter text for several fields. Some comments in the file may be considered inappropriate to some readers, but cleaning such data is typical in many data science projects.

## Note

<u>Show Work</u>

It's imperative to demonstrate the steps taken to arrive at solutions. Submissions undergo manual spot checks throughout the term to ensure integrity and discourage hardcoded answers. Failure to demonstrate the thought process can result in a lower grade.

For example, if the answer to Q1, the mean of a specific column, is 22:
